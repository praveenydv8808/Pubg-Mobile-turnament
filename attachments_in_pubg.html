				<h3>compansator:</h3>
					<ul> 
					<li><h4> The assault rifle compensator attachment helps to reduce recoil. Primarily it is designed to offer compensation to the vertical recoil from the assault rifles and offsets it by 15%. ... Unlike the assault rifle flash hider, the compensator still allows other players to see the full muzzle flash when you fire.</h4> </li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Supresser:</h3>
					<ul><h4>The assault rifle suppressor effectively reduces the amount of sound your rifles makes when firing and greatly reduces muzzle flash. The suppressor can give players a serious advantage over opponents who don't pay incredibly close attention to the audio cues in game.</h4>
					</ul>
				<h3>Grip:</h3>
				<ul><h4>It reduces the scope-in time, helps with weapon recoil (although not that much), and increases weapon steadiness. The thumb grip is good for long range shooting because it greatly improves your gun's Aim Down Sight.</h4>
				</ul>
				<h3>Stock:</h3>
				<ul><h4>Attaching a Tactical Stock decreases a weapon's recoil & shake. It also increases recovery after shots, making it easier to control your aim the next time you shoot.</h4>
				</ul>
				<h3>Extended:</h3>
				<ul><h4>Most of the assault rifles, designated marksman rifles and shotguns, including the S12K, can use this attachment and get the benefit of having extra ammo and an enhanced reload speed.</h4>
				</ul>
